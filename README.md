# Blazing Todo

This repository exists for my learning purposes: to keep me up to date with front-end technologies. The objective of this app is to provide a snappy feeling of the interaction when creating, renaming, and removing the todo. Hence the styling is still non-existent.

It's made with NextJS, so you the usual commands entails:

**Run in development mode**
```sh
yarn run dev
```

**Test it**
```sh
yarn run test
```


**Build the app**
```sh
yarn run build
```

**Serve the app**
```sh
yarn run start
```

Made with React (hooks not classes), NextJS, react-testing-library, GraphQL, and Apollo Client. The backend is using Hasura (yet to be incorporated in this repo).
